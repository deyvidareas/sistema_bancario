# Banking System Application

This project is a simple banking system application that allows users to deposit and withdraw money, as well as view their account balance and transaction history. The application is divided into two main parts: the backend, which is implemented in Python, and the frontend, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Bootstrap for styling.

## Project Structure

```

├── backend
│   └── sitema.py          # Python code for the banking system
├── frontend
│   ├── index.html         # Main HTML document for the user interface
│   ├── styles.css         # Custom CSS styles
│   └── app.js             # JavaScript code for user interactions
└── README.md              # Documentation for the project
```

## Backend

The backend is implemented in Python and contains the main logic for the banking system. The `sitema.py` file includes functions for:

- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money
- Displaying account balance
- Showing transaction history

## Frontend

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a graphical user interface for users to interact with the banking system. The main components include:

- `index.html`: The main structure of the application, which includes Bootstrap for responsive design.
- `styles.css`: Custom styles to enhance the appearance of the application.
- `app.js`: JavaScript code that handles user interactions, such as processing deposits and withdrawals, and communicating with the backend.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory and ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `sitema.py` file to start the backend server.
4. Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your web browser to access the application.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the interface to deposit or withdraw money.
